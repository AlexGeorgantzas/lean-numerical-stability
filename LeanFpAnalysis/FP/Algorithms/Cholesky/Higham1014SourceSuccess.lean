# Higham Theorem 10.14: source-threshold success bridge

The determinate first conclusion of Theorem 10.14 is that Algorithm 10.2
successfully completes its first `r` stages under display (10.21).  The source
obtains this by applying Theorem 10.7 to the positive-definite leading block.
This file records that locality step for the literal rounded Cholesky executor.

The subsequent display (10.22) contains an unquantified `O(u^2)` term and is
therefore intentionally not represented by this theorem.

/-- **Theorem 10.14 / display (10.21), exact source success statement.**

Let `A11` be the leading `r × r` block of `A`.  If `A11` is positive definite
and the minimum eigenvalue of its diagonally scaled form exceeds
`r * gamma_(r+1) / (1 - gamma_(r+1))`, then the concrete rounded Algorithm
10.2 run on `A` has a positive raw pivot at every stage below `r`.

No pivot trace, error certificate, strengthened smallness inequality, or
no-ties hypothesis is assumed.  Positive semidefiniteness and rank of the full
matrix are not needed for this success implication, so omitting them makes the
formal theorem slightly stronger than the corresponding clause in the book. -/
