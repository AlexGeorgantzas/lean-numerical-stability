## Notation

Coefficients are stored in descending order `[a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_0]`, matching
`Horner.lean`.  For such a list `c` of length `n + 1`:

* `polyDesc x c = a_n x^n + ... + a_0` is `p(x)`               (Higham (5.1));
* `polyDescAbs x c = |a_n| |x|^n + ... + |a_0|` is `p~(|x|)`   (Higham (5.3));
* `polyDescDeriv x c = p'(x)` and `polyDescDerivAbs x c = p~'(|x|)`;
* the rounded Algorithm 5.2 output is `fl_hornerDerivativeDesc fp x c`, whose
  first component is the rounded value `fl(p(x))` and whose second component is
  the rounded first derivative.

The relevant "number of operations" constant is `2 n = 2 (c.length - 1)`.

that every coefficient perturbation stays inside a single `gamma_(2n)`
envelope. -/

/-! ## Section 5.1 / equation (5.3): the sign-pattern corollary `psi(p,x) = 1`

Higham (5.3) bounds the relative error of Horner's method (Algorithm 5.1) by
`gamma_(2n) * psi(p,x)`, where `psi(p,x) = p~(|x|) / |p(x)|` can be arbitrarily
large.  The book notes that `psi(p,x) = 1` — perfect relative accuracy up to
`gamma_(2n)` — precisely when `a_i >= 0` for all `i` and `x >= 0`, or when
`(-1)^i a_i >= 0` for all `i` and `x <= 0`.  We formalize both sign patterns and
derive the collapsed relative bound `|fl(p(x)) - p(x)| <= gamma_(2n) |p(x)|`. -/

/-- Nonnegative-coefficient sign pattern: with `x >= 0` and every coefficient
nonnegative, every monomial `a_i x^i` equals `|a_i| |x|^i`, so the exact value
already equals its absolute-coefficient majorant. -/

head coefficient `a` (the coefficient of `x^(rest.length)`) satisfies
