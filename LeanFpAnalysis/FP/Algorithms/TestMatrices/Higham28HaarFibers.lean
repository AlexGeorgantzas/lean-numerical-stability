/-! # Two finite homogeneous-space uniqueness principles

These lemmas isolate the measure theory used in Stewart's orthogonal-matrix
producer.  The first says that a probability law on a group is determined by
its quotient coordinate and a Haar-distributed right fiber.  The second is
uniqueness of an invariant probability law for a transitive group action.
Both arguments are direct applications of Tonelli's theorem.

/-- Two probability measures on `G` agree when they have the same `π`
push-forward, are invariant along the same right `H`-fibers, and every fiber
has a measurable representative.  The measure `ν` supplies the normalized
left-Haar average on a fiber. -/
