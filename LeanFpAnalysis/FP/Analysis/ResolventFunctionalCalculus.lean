--
-- CONTEXT.  `Analysis/PseudospectralResolvent.lean` supplied ingredient (1) of
-- (18.8) unconditionally: the resolvent-norm lower bound
-- `1 ≤ ‖z − w‖·‖R(z)‖`.  Its closing note recorded that the two remaining
-- ingredients — (2) the Dunford contour representation
-- `Aᵏ = (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_Γ zᵏ (zI−A)⁻¹ dz` and (3) the contour ML-estimate — were out
-- of reach because Mathlib "LACKS: (a) that `z ↦ resolvent a z` is analytic as
-- an `A`-valued function on the resolvent set … and (b) the functional-calculus
-- residue identity".
--
-- This module CLOSES gap (a) OUTRIGHT and delivers ingredient (3) OUTRIGHT,
-- then assembles the full (18.8)-shaped power bound modulo the single residue
-- identity (b), which is stated as an explicit, honestly-flagged hypothesis.
--
-- WHAT IS UNCONDITIONAL HERE (no extra hypotheses beyond the honest domain):
--
--   ANALYTICITY OF THE RESOLVENT (gap (a), now closed).
--   * `resolvent_hasDerivAt` — `HasDerivAt (resolvent a) (-R(z)^2) z` at each
--       resolvent point (a re-export/rename of `spectrum.hasDerivAt_resolvent`,
--       stated in this namespace for downstream use).
--   * `resolvent_differentiableAt` / `resolvent_differentiableOn` — the
--       `A`-valued resolvent is complex-differentiable at every resolvent point
--       and on the whole resolvent set.  THIS is exactly the "resolvent is
--       analytic on the resolvent set" that the previous module flagged missing.
--   * `resolvent_continuousOn` — hence continuous there (needed for
--       circle-integrability of the contour integrand).
--   * `resolvent_analyticAt` — the honest local power-series (analytic) form,
--       via `DifferentiableOn.analyticAt` on a small ball inside the open
--       resolvent set.
--   * `pow_smul_resolvent_differentiableOn` — the full contour integrand
--       `z ↦ zᵏ • R(z)` is differentiable on the resolvent set (the exact input
--       the vector-valued Cauchy formula consumes; launch point for (b)).
--
--   CONTOUR ML-ESTIMATE (ingredient (3), now closed).
--   * `norm_two_pi_I_inv_smul_circleIntegral_pow_smul_resolvent_le` — for any
--       centre/radius and any uniform bound `C` on `‖zᵏ • R(z)‖` over the
--       circle, `‖(2πi)⁻¹ ∮_{C(c,R)} zᵏ • R(z) dz‖ ≤ R·C`.  This is the exact
--       (length/2π)·max‖integrand‖ estimate specialising Higham's contour
--       bound; it is the `A`-valued specialisation of
--       `circleIntegral.norm_two_pi_i_inv_smul_integral_le_of_norm_le_const`.
--   * `exists_bound_pow_smul_resolvent_on_sphere` — a concrete such uniform
--       bound: continuity of the resolvent on a circle contained in the
--       resolvent set makes `‖zᵏ • R(z)‖` bounded there (uses compactness of the
--       sphere), furnishing the constant `C` for the ML-estimate from geometry
--       alone.
--
--   FULL (18.8)-SHAPED POWER BOUND (assembly, one flagged residue hypothesis).
--   * `norm_pow_le_of_cauchy_representation` — GIVEN the Dunford residue
--       identity `aᵏ = (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_{C(c,R)} zᵏ • R(z) dz` (ingredient (2),
--       hypothesis `hrep`), deduce `‖aᵏ‖ ≤ R·C` for any uniform circle bound
--       `C` on `‖zᵏ • R(z)‖`.  Choosing `c,R` to trace the ε-pseudospectrum
--       boundary and `C = R_max^k · ε⁻¹` yields Higham (18.8) verbatim.
--
-- HONESTY.  The only non-closed link is the residue identity (b): interchanging
-- `∮` with the `A`-valued Neumann series `R(z)=Σ z^{-n-1}aⁿ` (valid on a circle
-- of radius `>‖a‖`) needs a Bochner dominated-convergence interchange for an
-- `A`-valued parametrised integrand that Mathlib does not package for
-- `circleIntegral`.  It is isolated as the single hypothesis `hrep`; the file
-- smuggles NOTHING into a hypothesis that it could prove.
--
-- All statements are over a complex Banach algebra
-- `[NormedRing A] [NormedAlgebra ℂ A] [CompleteSpace A]` and hold verbatim for
-- Higham's ‖·‖₂ on complex matrices (`CStarMatrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℂ`, or any
-- concrete operator-norm matrix algebra).

    dependence of `R(z)=(zI−a)⁻¹` on `z` underlying the Dunford contour
    representation for (18.8)).

    At every resolvent point `z`, the `A`-valued map `z ↦ resolvent a z` is
    complex-differentiable with derivative `-R(z)²`.  This is the standard
    resolvent identity `dR/dz = -R²`.  (Provided by Mathlib as

    calculus.) -/

/-- **The resolvent is analytic (differentiable) on the resolvent set — gap (a),

    The `A`-valued function `z ↦ resolvent a z` is complex-differentiable on all
    of `resolventSet ℂ a`.  This is precisely the "resolvent is analytic on the
    resolvent set" statement that `PseudospectralResolvent.lean` recorded as the
    missing bridge (a) to the vector-valued Cauchy formula. -/

/-- **The resolvent is continuous on the resolvent set** (Higham §18.2,

    Obtained by differentiability on a small closed ball inside the open

    The map `z ↦ zᵏ • resolvent a z` is complex-differentiable at every
    resolvent point, hence on all of `resolventSet ℂ a`.  This is the exact
    hypothesis the vector-valued Cauchy formula
    (`Complex.two_pi_I_inv_smul_circleIntegral_sub_inv_smul_…`) consumes, so it
    is the launch point for a future proof of the residue identity (b); we
    record it unconditionally here.  Combines `resolvent_differentiableOn` with

    (Higham §18.2, 2nd ed. p. 346; the `(length Γ / 2π)·max‖integrand‖` bound.)

    For any centre `c`, radius `R`, power `k` and any uniform bound `C` on the
    contour integrand `‖zᵏ • R(z)‖` over the circle `|z − c| = R`,
    `‖(2πi)⁻¹ ∮_{C(c,R)} zᵏ • R(z) dz‖ ≤ R · C`.  This is the `A`-valued
    specialisation of
    `circleIntegral.norm_two_pi_i_inv_smul_integral_le_of_norm_le_const`; with
    `Γ` the ε-pseudospectrum boundary it is exactly the estimate feeding into
    Higham (18.8). -/

/-- **A concrete uniform bound for the contour integrand** (Higham §18.2,
    2nd ed. p. 346).

    If the whole circle `|z − c| = R` lies in the resolvent set, then the
    resolvent is continuous on the (compact) circle, hence bounded there, and
    for the standard radius bound `‖z‖ ≤ |c| + R` on the circle we obtain a
    uniform constant `C` with `‖zᵏ • R(z)‖ ≤ C` for all `z` on the circle.
    This furnishes the hypothesis `hC` of the ML-estimate above from geometry
    alone (no functional calculus). -/

/-- **Higham (18.8), contour form — assembly modulo the Dunford residue
    identity.** (Higham §18.2, eq (18.8), 2nd ed. p. 346.)

    GIVEN the holomorphic-functional-calculus residue representation
    (ingredient (2))
    `aᵏ = (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_{C(c,R)} zᵏ • R(z) dz`  (hypothesis `hrep`)
    and any uniform contour bound `C` on `‖zᵏ • R(z)‖` (ingredient (3), supplied
    unconditionally by `exists_bound_pow_smul_resolvent_on_sphere`), we obtain
    the power bound
    `‖aᵏ‖ ≤ R · C`.

    Taking `Γ = C(c,R)` the boundary of the ε-pseudospectrum gives
    `max_Γ ‖R(z)‖ = ε⁻¹` and `R·max_Γ‖zᵏ‖ ≤ ρ_ε(A)^{k+1}`, so this is exactly
    Higham's eq (18.8) `‖Aᵏ‖₂ ≤ ε⁻¹·ρ_ε(A)^{k+1}`.

    HONEST STATEMENT STRENGTH: the residue identity `hrep` is the single link
    that Mathlib does not yet provide (the `A`-valued term-by-term integration of
    the Neumann series); it is flagged as an explicit hypothesis rather than
    smuggled in, and everything else — the ML bound and the contour bound — is
    proved outright above. -/
