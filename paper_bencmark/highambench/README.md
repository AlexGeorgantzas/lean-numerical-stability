# HighamBench construction corpus

This directory contains a 20-paper construction corpus for testing whether
access to the NumStability Lean library helps an agent finish fixed Lean proofs.
A fixed proof means that the theorem statement is chosen before a run and the
agent may change only the proof.

The current corpus contains 60 tasks drawn from papers P01--P20, with three
fixed tasks per paper. Task rebuilding and independent faithfulness auditing are
currently active. The committed global snapshot metadata may therefore describe
an earlier checkpoint and must not be used to start measurements. A new
construction snapshot will be generated after the active cycle settles, and a
measurement-ready snapshot will be created only after all repairs, audits, tier
decisions, and construction checks are complete. Paper titles, source hashes,
exact task locations, and the ordered task catalog are recorded in
`metadata/manifest.json` at each finalized checkpoint.

## Task types

Each paper contributes one task of each type used by the HighamBench 0.2
specification:

- T1, direct use: apply or specialize a close existing NumStability result.
- T2, combine: join multiple existing results with additional reasoning.
- T3, extend: prove a result requiring material not already supplied as a
  complete NumStability theorem.

The manifest and per-task records contain each selected result, source tag,
paper location, fixed Lean statement, and task-specific rationale.

The local paper PDFs are recorded source copies and remain subject to their
publishers' terms. The benchmark metadata records source locators and hashes and
uses short paraphrases instead of copying long passages from the papers.

## One construction workflow for every paper

P01 through P20 use the same task schema, source-tag rules,
construction checker, run-order rule, report builder, and hash refresh command.
No paper ID is special-cased by an operational script.

The Lean setting is also uniform without making all papers share all
definitions. `shared/HighamBench/Core.lean` contains only definitions used by
more than one paper. `P01Definitions.lean` and `P02Definitions.lean` contain
only their own paper's extra models and algorithms. Each controlled task
contains the core plus its own paper file. Each trusted compiled bundle follows
the same rule, so a P01 run cannot import the P02 module and a P02 run cannot
import the P01 module.

Every paper and task in the measurement snapshot has
`classification_frozen_before_runs` set to `true`. The selected results, task
statements, contexts, and Lean targets are fixed and must not change during the
experiment. Any controlled change requires a new snapshot and a complete rerun.

During an active multi-task rebuild or audit cycle, task-local changes may be
committed and audited before corpus-wide hashes are regenerated. Global snapshot
metadata is intentionally provisional during that interval and no benchmark
measurement may run.

At a stable checkpoint, after all task and audit writers have finished, refresh
all derived metadata once with:

```text
python3 paper_bencmark/highambench/tools/refresh_snapshot.py \
  --benchmark-root paper_bencmark/highambench --phase construction
```

Only after the complete corpus, proofs, and reviews are ready should the same
command be run with `--phase measurement-ready`. The benchmark runner rejects
construction-state tasks, so a partial corpus cannot be measured accidentally.

## Two conditions

- `N` means no NumStability library. No source, compiled library file,
  documentation, search index, declaration-name list, or cache from the library
  may be visible.
- `L` means the frozen NumStability source and compiled files are available for
  local use and local search.

Both conditions for a task use the same fixed statement, source material,
paper-scoped task definitions, Lean version, mathlib revision, common agent
prompt, tools, time limit, token limit, and machine class. The controlled
condition-L supplement described below is the only intended prompt difference.
Each attempt starts in a new bubblewrap
namespace, meaning a fresh restricted view of files and processes, and a new
conversation. Model-generated shell commands cannot create network sockets.
The shell supervisor records denied socket activity in a per-run marker. The
outer runner watches that marker with a separate kernel event queue, so deleting
or clearing the file cannot hide an earlier change. Any recorded attempt is a
failure, even when the Lean proof itself is valid. It is labeled
`RULE_VIOLATION` unless a time limit, token limit, or missing submission has the
higher-priority failure label. The launcher also blocks attempts to signal its
supervisor and closes inherited file handles before starting Bash.
Both conditions see the same separately staged package runtime: mathlib Lean
source files plus each package's base `.olean` files and the matching
`.olean.server`, `.olean.private`, and `.ir` support files needed by Lean 4.29.
No other package-build files are staged. The original `.lake/packages`
checkout, its Git data, build traces, and caches are not mounted in an attempt.

### Frozen condition-L prompt supplement

Prompt protocol `signposted-library-v1` uses `agent_prompt.md` as the common
prompt and appends the byte-frozen `condition_prompts/L.md` only in condition
L. Condition N receives no condition supplement: the L file is not passed to
its adapter and is not staged or mounted in its namespace.

The L supplement explicitly says that the agent may search and use the frozen
NumStability snapshot at commit
`45813a95dacf577461bae13f033af0dbc985a225`. Inside the L namespace its exact
read-only locations are:

- source tree: `/library/NumStability`;
- root source file: `/library/NumStability.lean`;
- compiled Lean tree: `/library-olean`.

The supplement explains that `/library-olean` is already on `LEAN_PATH`, that
only modules with a corresponding `.olean` below that tree are importable, and
how a compiled path maps to a dotted Lean import. It gives generic local
`find`, `rg`, `import`, `#check`, and `#print` command templates. It supplies no
target-relevant theorem, module, declaration, search term, adapter, or private
proof hint; the agent must discover relevance itself. Source-only files may be
searched but are not added to the importable object set.

The trusted adapter composes the L request in this order: common prompt, L-only
supplement, task context, fixed target. The condition supplement changes
neither `context.md` nor `Target.lean`, and it changes no task statement or
shared definition. An L submission may add a NumStability import, but the
controlled target remains byte-identical to N. Any supplement edit changes the
controlled hashes and environment identity and requires a fresh measurement.

The Codex control process still needs its provider connection, and this setup
uses fresh bubblewrap namespaces rather than a frozen OCI container image.
Those concrete limitations are recorded with the measurements. All results are
private preparation artifacts and are not approved for public release.

The frozen agent preset is `gpt-5.6-sol` with reasoning effort `ultra`. Full
Ultra V2 automatic task delegation is enabled. At most four root/subagent
inference threads may run concurrently in one attempt. Every child is locked
to `gpt-5.6-sol`/`ultra`; the model and reasoning-effort override fields are
hidden from `spawn_agent`, as is spawn-agent metadata. These locks are part of
the environment identity, not choices left to an evaluated agent.

The same configuration presents an exact usage hint: `fork_turns` must be
omitted (the full-history default), `"all"`, or `"none"`; positive integers
and every other value are unavailable. A synchronous pre-tool-use hook enforces
that rule before child creation. Its generated helper and `hooks.json` are
SHA-256-frozen, staged under the private per-attempt state root, and mounted
read-only at their recorded paths in the temporary Codex home. The CLI carries
the frozen hook-trust-bypass flag, while the pinned app-server obtains the
effective bypass from `thread/start.params.config={"bypass_hook_trust":true}`.
Those two trust inputs and the effective source are separate frozen fields.

The fixed measured limit is 1,800 seconds and 5,000,000 total model tokens per
run. The 5,000,000-token cap is the current user-authorized protocol deviation
from the earlier 2,000,000-token project freeze and is applied identically to N
and L. A separate 120-second prompt-startup timeout does not consume that measured
wall-clock allowance. A model token is a small piece of text counted by the
model service. Failed runs receive 1,800 seconds in the main time comparison,
while their real stop time is also kept.

Every attempt uses the authenticated `highambench-prompt-release-v1` READY/GO/
RELEASED handshake. The isolated adapter first seals a READY record before it
starts the model turn. The runner verifies READY and authorizes GO only when at
least five seconds of the startup window remain. Immediately before writing the
exact `turn/start` request, the adapter records RELEASED with a monotonic
timestamp, then records the post-flush timestamp. The runner reconstructs and
hash-checks the request wire, identities, prompt bytes, nonce, and command-line
paths, and re-reads all three canonical JSON artifacts as regular, non-symlink,
mode-0444 files. The measured 1,800-second deadline is derived only from the
authenticated RELEASED pre-write timestamp. A timeout before GO starts no useful
work; missing or invalid evidence after GO is retained as an unscored system
incident rather than retried as if no work occurred.

The only automatic retry is one failure proven to occur before prompt release.
Its incident record is canonically self-hashed and binds the exact normalized
attempt record, raw transcript, frozen assignment/environment/hardware, and
attempt-specific immutable log copies. On every resumption these records are
replayed before any provider subprocess starts. A terminal, unscorable, or
incomplete retry incident remains a hard stop even if an active-run marker was
removed.

The adapter consumes `rawResponse/completed` events from Codex app-server and
sums the provider usage of every completed response in the rooted attempt
thread tree. Response IDs are deduplicated across the root and all recursively
linked Ultra children. A response's input total already includes its cached
input portion, so cached input is charged once rather than added a second time.
Projection schema v4 binds each child to the exact raw `spawn_agent` function
call by requiring `raw_function_call.call_id = subAgentActivity.id`. For a
`fork_turns=all` child, the expected inherited cumulative baseline is the
parent's expected baseline plus all completed parent responses preceding the
spawn response; `fork_turns=none` has the exact zero baseline. The runner, the
result-set checker, and the report renderer separately recompute the expected
baseline, full and boundary-adjusted projection, final cumulative observation,
spawn-ID sets, and graph-completeness Booleans. It also requires exactly one
authenticated `hook/started` and one authenticated `hook/completed` event for
every raw spawn call. Omitted, `"all"`, and `"none"` calls must be allowed;
positive-integer or malformed calls must be policy-blocked, recorded as failed,
and have no activity, collaboration record, or child. The adapter, runner,
result-set checker, and both report renderers independently authenticate the
policy fingerprint and rederive those per-call decisions. Every naturally
drained thread must match its full app-server projection. Schema v4 uses the
authenticated provider-gate response ledger as the authoritative token total
and reconciles every response either to a direct app-server delivery or to the
narrow suppressed collaboration-wait case with successor child-result evidence.
The raw app-server response and cumulative ledgers remain unchanged structural
evidence; suppressed-response tokens are not folded into them. Only the accepted
root response may use the narrow
authenticated nested-submission exception; a token-limit endpoint uses the
separate sealed provider-gate crossing described below.
The adapter atomically writes the live cumulative ledger to a trusted result-log
path outside the model's workspace. For an Ultra pass, the coordinator first
waits until every descendant is quiescent, develops and checks the fixed
`Candidate.lean`, and then emits one sole/final outer custom `exec` item with the
exact 98-byte program
`// @exec: {"yield_time_ms": 2400000}` followed by a newline and
`await tools.submit_proof({candidate_path:"Candidate.lean"});` followed by a
newline. App-server starts
the nested root-only `submit_proof` dynamic call while that outer exec remains
unresolved. The adapter snapshots the candidate bytes at the inner call and
authenticates both the outer and inner identities, their ordering, the run nonce,
validator contract, root thread, response, and current deduplicated usage ledger.
Only the root coordinator may submit. The hidden runner validates that immutable
snapshot in a pristine frozen workspace.

Every accepted or rejected hidden-validation record is bound to the run, task,
candidate bytes, target theorem, controlled manifest, validator contract, and,
for Ultra, the authenticated request hash and sequence. The record has a
canonical self-hash, while the run separately records the validation file's
byte hash. Passing records therefore authenticate the exact immutable candidate
that reached the blocked boundary; a rejected candidate remains auditable even
when the attempt later ends without an accepted proof.

On acceptance, the runner deliberately leaves the inner dynamic call blocked:
it sends no inner tool response, emits no outer exec output, and terminates the
app-server out of band. The root turn therefore remains blocked, all descendants
remain quiescent, and no later model response is possible. The exact passing
total includes the completed outer response containing that custom exec item and
stops there. `drain_complete=false` is therefore expected for a pass: exactness
comes from the authenticated schema-v5 nested boundary, not a natural tree drain.
Schema v5 records exactly one of two asynchronous observation orders:
`inner_dynamic_call_before_raw_response_completed` or
`raw_response_completed_before_inner_dynamic_call`. The matching two Boolean
flags must be exclusive, the monotonic timestamps must agree with that enum,
and both the inner-call observation and raw-response completion must precede
boundary publication.
The exact 2,400,000-ms yield is transport-only: it does not extend the measured
deadline. Its timer begins no earlier than authenticated prompt release, and it
strictly exceeds the 1,800-second measured interval plus the 369-second
validation/teardown reserve by 231 seconds. Any outer progress output remains
forbidden and invalidates the boundary.
First-valid time is the interval from the authenticated RELEASED pre-write
timestamp to publication of that boundary after completion of the same outer raw
response. The retained request record is self-hashed and its publication
timestamp is cross-bound to the usage-boundary summary; the earlier candidate
capture at inner-call start is not the scored endpoint. Hidden validation time
is recorded separately.
The allocation gate reserves a separate, non-scored 369 seconds for every
unfinished run: two 120-second Lean compilations, one 120-second dependency
audit, the five-second accepted-boundary close, and two two-second forced-stop
grace windows. Together with two possible 120-second pre-prompt startup
windows and the 1,800-second measured interval, an untouched N/L pair requires
5,418 seconds including the separate 600-second general-overhead guard. The
matrix stops before starting the pair when the enclosing Slurm allocation has
less time remaining.

Every counted `POST /responses` request passes through the frozen loopback
provider gate under `highambench-provider-token-gate-v6`. The gate authenticates
the model catalog, Ultra effort, 272,000-token response bound, request metadata,
direct TLS transport, and each app-server usage notification. It admits
concurrent work only while
`completed_tokens + (open_request_count + 1) * response_bound < token_limit`.
When that reservation would reach the cap, it first drains existing provider
requests and then admits at most one exclusive response.

Gate v6 requests `Accept: text/event-stream`, requires status 200 and identity
content encoding, and accepts at most one `Content-Type` and one
`Content-Encoding` occurrence. A declared content type must be exactly
`text/event-stream` with at most an optional UTF-8 charset. A missing
`Content-Type` is compatible only after the complete upstream body passes the
frozen strict byte-level SSE parser; the receipt binds the parser, event counts,
completion position, optional `[DONE]`, body byte count/hash, response ID,
header-presence bases, and downstream synthesized-content-type flag. Endpoint
or request headers alone never authenticate an untyped body. This transport
compatibility amendment and every gate check remain identical for N and L.

At the first completed total greater than or equal to 5,000,000, that response
must therefore be the sole in-flight request. The gate seals the exact crossing
and releases no action-capable model output: an ordinary turn receives only a
minimal sanitized completion, while a compaction request receives exactly one
inert `Compaction` completion item followed by the minimal completion needed by
the pinned app-server collector. It then closes with reason `token_limit`.
Projection v6 authenticates each gate call's response-output manifest and
delivery record, then reconciles provider-authoritative totals against direct
app-server responses, authenticated suppressed collaboration waits,
collaboration-message supersessions, and child responses discarded only after
an exact parent `interrupt_agent` sequence. It also authenticates the
interrupt chronology without assuming which provider request was admitted
first: both the child and interrupting parent requests must be admitted before
the parent response commits, that response must be directly bound before the
child response commits, the child must have been admitted before the first
interrupt lifecycle event, and every such event's full millisecond interval
must precede the child commit. It also authenticates the
event-ordered response IDs, final mode-0444 gate artifact, and immediate clean
adapter teardown. A scoreable `TOKEN_LIMIT`
endpoint need not claim a natural tree drain;
provider requests and handlers are quiescent even though the model tree remains
active. Overshoot is bounded by the one frozen-bound exclusive response, and no
concurrent response tail is possible. Other unsuccessful outcomes still require
the exact natural-drain endpoint; missing or inconsistent gate evidence is an
unscored system incident.

The frozen Codex binary also lists `rollout_budget`. Strict configuration enables
it with the same limit and weights input and generated tokens by 1, but this is
only an advisory provider-side guard. Cached-inclusive benchmark enforcement
comes from the authenticated provider gate and its completed-response ledger;
runner polling is an independent fail-closed observer.

Each run also starts a new materialized Codex root thread in a unique temporary
state directory with `history.persistence=none`, memories disabled, and no
thread resume or fork. Materialization is required because the frozen Codex
0.146 MultiAgentV2 runtime cannot resolve an ephemeral coordinator during child
spawn. The state directory is deleted on normal adapter exit and is never
reused or mounted by another attempt, including if abnormal termination leaves private
rollout bytes behind. Thus Ultra children and stored history cannot enter a
later attempt.
The workspace contains no prior submission or result. Provider prompt caching,
when reported as cached input tokens, reuses computation for an exact input
prefix; it does not retrieve a previous answer or proof and carries no
conversation history between runs. Cached input is nevertheless charged at full
weight against the 5,000,000-token benchmark limit.

Two independent private live canaries are required before a scored run. The
synthetic Ultra orchestration canary has ID
`ULTRA-ORCHESTRATION-SUBMISSION-CANARY-V12`; it is not a matrix assignment and does not use
or edit a benchmark task: its authenticated prompt first requires a completed
root response, a deliberately denied root `fork_turns="3"` call, and then one
allowed `fork_turns="all"` delegation. That child deliberately attempts one
`fork_turns="3"` grandchild, which must also be denied before it returns its
marker. Offline replay must authenticate both denials with no corresponding
child activity, match the one allowed raw spawn call to its subagent activity,
rederive a positive inherited child baseline and a complete projection-v6
ledger, and prove the same exact
authenticated submission boundary used by a passing run. Its root remains
blocked (`drain_complete=false`) while descendants are quiescent and the retained
challenge/call/request/ack/snapshot chain is read-only and authenticated. The
synthetic candidate must also pass the real hidden semantic/dependency audit
through the frozen `tools/dependency_audit.lean` helper; the exact audit command
is bound into the validator contract and the retained helper copy is hashed.
The separate 14-artifact token canary has ID
`TOKEN-CONTROL-SYNTHETIC-PROVIDER-GATE-V8` and prompt protocol
`synthetic-inert-sanitized-provider-gate-compaction-crossing-v8`. It uses a
private synthetic non-matrix target and inert prompt, so it tests the production
gate without exposing any benchmark task, context, target bytes, or proof
prefix. At the fixed 180,000-token cap its first root-turn response must finish
below the cap and be released byte-for-byte. The adapter then explicitly sends
`thread/compact/start`; the second, distinct compaction-turn response must be the
sole crossing and may release only the canonical inert `Compaction` item and
minimal completed event. Its event-ordered projection-v6 evidence authenticates
both responses, the gate calls and direct app-server deliveries, the closed
`token_limit` endpoint, and the mode-0444 final gate artifact. Tree drain and
cumulative projection completion are deliberately false at this endpoint;
spawn/hook sets remain empty and the independent gate endpoint makes token
measurement exact. Its attestation states `scored=false`,
`matrix_assignment=false`, `synthetic_input=true`, and
`benchmark_task_bytes_used=false`. Both frozen
canaries must independently reauthenticate the same READY/GO/RELEASED protocol
and derive their timing deadlines from RELEASED. Both frozen
descriptors currently remain `replacement_required`, so matrix startup fails
closed.

Run `tools/run_ultra_orchestration_canary.py` first with the same frozen host,
binary, authentication, toolchain, and mount arguments used by `run_matrix.py`.
Explicitly promote its generated `ultra_orchestration_canary_attestation.json`
with `tools/promote_live_canary.py --ultra-orchestration-attestation ...`; mere
file presence never changes a descriptor to `passed`. Next run
`tools/run_token_control_canary.py` and explicitly promote its
`token_control_canary_attestation.json` with
`--token-control-attestation ...`. Promotion authenticates every referenced
artifact, updates only the named evidence/descriptors and frozen hashes, and
does not rewrite task, target, context, or shared files. This repository and all
resulting measurements remain private pre-publication work; nothing is
authorized for public release yet.

## Protocol-governance disclosure

These measurements must not be labeled a strict implementation of the
reference-PDF HighamBench 0.2 protocol. They use the previously disclosed
`signposted-library-v1` condition-L prompt, lack a demonstrated backend random
seed, and do not run from a frozen OCI image. They also add a HighamBench
execution-protocol amendment: an external trusted provider gate buffers
responses, reserves the frozen worst-case response bound, and makes the token
endpoint call-atomic by switching to one exclusive request before a possible
crossing. This is not behavior supplied by the frozen Codex binary. The same
gate, configuration, and verification rules are applied to N and L, so the
paired comparison remains symmetric, but results must be described as produced
by this explicitly amended HighamBench-derived protocol.

## Repetitions and run order

Each task-condition pair is repeated three times. The IDs `rep-01`, `rep-02`,
and `rep-03` are repetition IDs, not model random seeds. No backend seed is
claimed because this repository does not currently have proof that the selected
agent backend accepts and obeys a seed. If a backend with real seed support is
used later, its seed values must be added to the raw run record before evaluation.

There are 360 planned runs:

`60 tasks x 3 repetitions x 2 conditions = 360 runs`.

The first condition in each pair was selected by the fixed SHA-256 rule recorded
in `metadata/run_order.json`. SHA-256 is a repeatable text-to-number calculation.
It makes the order reproducible without presenting repetition IDs as random
seeds.

### Separation from the raw-access P01 measurements

The completed P01 measurements made before `signposted-library-v1` used the
earlier raw-access protocol, in which the L mount was available without this
explicit library notice. Those records remain preserved as a separate
experiment. They must not be overwritten, pooled with, or used
as repetitions of a signposted run. A signposted P01 measurement uses fresh
agent contexts and its own prompt hash, environment identity, result root, and
report; the task statements and task contexts stay unchanged.

## Files

- `../TASK_SOURCE_TAGS.md` defines the mandatory source-presentation tags for
  every task. `../AGENTS.md` makes that policy persistent across Codex
  sessions, and `tools/task_tags.py` checks every current task record.
- `tools/refresh_snapshot.py` validates the corpus and regenerates its derived
  metadata: each task's controlled files and hashes, condition order, corpus
  counts, and snapshot and environment identifiers.
- `shared/HighamBench/Core.lean` is the small cross-paper core.
  `shared/HighamBench/P*Definitions.lean` files add only one paper's models and
  algorithms. Manifest scopes and separate compiled bundles keep them isolated.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` explains the construction decisions and the checks
  required before measured runs.
- `metadata/manifest.json` records all 20 papers, their source hashes, the
  specification hash, all 60 tasks, and their exact source locations.
- `metadata/config.json` freezes the environment and run limits.
- `metadata/run_order.json` fixes the order of N and L for every paired
  repetition.
- `metadata/reviews/` contains construction-stage review records. They are
  evidence from earlier snapshots, not final immutable approvals; final review
  records must be regenerated for every task before measurement.

The review files distinguish completed checks from pending or rejected checks;
pending and rejected checks are not rewritten as passes. All 60 public target
skeletons have paper-scoped source and compiled bundles, and
`metadata/evidence/construction_validation_full_current.json` records 120/120
successful private N/L construction checks, including construction proofs for
P02. Two fresh-context Codex reviews remain part of the frozen evidence. Their
exact-target novelty rejections for the union of thirteen T1 tasks are ignored
only by `private_measurement_review_override` for this private, pre-publication
measurement. Source-fidelity defects are not ignored. The complete 360-run
measured matrix is still required before the final report can be built.

## What a result may say

Once all internal freeze and measurement gates pass, this experiment may show
whether library access
changed proof success, time, token use, or actual library use for these sixty
fixed tasks and one fixed agent setup. It does not test translation from
English into Lean or human proof development. Uncertainty intervals resample
the twenty whole papers as clusters; they must not be presented as certainty
beyond this corpus and setup.
