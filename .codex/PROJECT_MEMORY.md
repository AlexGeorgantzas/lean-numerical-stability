# Codex Project Memory

Project: `LeanFpAnalysis`, a Lean 4 library for floating-point arithmetic and
automatic stability analysis. The model is axiomatic and intentionally not tied
to IEEE 754. All core results should be stated over `FPModel` and `Real`.

Last review by Codex: 2026-04-28.
Current `main` is for the stable core library.  The main commit before the
end-to-end stability rebuild is tagged as
`main-stable-before-end-to-end-20260527` at
`d5c0fa90c69c36f794f176c96f2dd4d293bb5aa3`.
Benchmark work lives on branch `benchmark`.

## Build State

- `lake build` succeeds with Lean toolchain `leanprover/lean4:v4.29.0-rc3`.
- No real `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, or `opaque` declarations were found in
  `LeanFpAnalysis`.
- Current build warnings are cleanup warnings concentrated in QR/least-squares:
  unused simp arguments in `QR/GivensSpec.lean`, unused variables in
  `QR/HouseholderQR.lean`, `QR/GivensQR.lean`, `QR/QRSolve.lean`,
  `LeastSquares/LSQRSolve.lean`, `LeastSquares/LSNormalEquations.lean`, and
  `FastMatMul.lean`.
- After the 2026-04-26 fix pass, `main` was fast-forward merged to
  `015d6c4`.  Later benchmark work was split onto branch `benchmark`.
- `.vscode/` remains unrelated untracked local editor state.

## Earlier Context Found

- Old in-repo agent settings and benchmark prompt files were removed so the
  repository no longer carries tool-specific benchmark guidance.
- Earlier project notes framed the project as a VSCL/Thrust A thesis library
  for compositional stability-carrying foundations, not as a goal to formalize
  all of Higham.
- Durable user/project preferences: formalize only reusable stepping stones for
  future stability proofs; always search the existing codebase before claiming
  a theorem or definition is missing; put proof sketches in docstrings; keep
  Higham constants exact.

## Top-Level Structure

- `LeanFpAnalysis.lean` imports `LeanFpAnalysis.FP`.
- `LeanFpAnalysis/FP.lean` imports `Model`, `Analysis`, and `Algorithms`.
- `LeanFpAnalysis/FP/Analysis.lean` re-exports:
  `Error`, `Rounding`, `Summation`, `SubtractionFold`, `Stability`,
  `ForwardError`, `MatrixAlgebra`, `PerturbationTheory`.
- `LeanFpAnalysis/FP/Algorithms.lean` re-exports the algorithm families:
  summation, dot/matvec/matmul, triangular solves and bounds, LU, Cholesky,
  QR, least squares, Sylvester, iterative refinement, matrix inversion,
  stationary iteration, matrix powers, underdetermined systems, fast matmul.

## Foundation Modules

- `Model.lean`: `FPModel` with `u`, `u_nonneg`, `fl_add/sub/mul/div/sqrt`,
  exact `fl_add_zero`, and standard relative-error axioms for each operation.
  The square-root axiom is stated for nonnegative inputs.
- `Analysis/Error.lean`: `absError`, `relError`, `compRelErrorBounded`.
- `Analysis/Stability.lean`: scalar/vector backward-error predicates,
  componentwise relative backward stability, scalar `condNumber`, and
  `forward_from_backward`.
- `Analysis/Rounding.lean`: `gamma`, `gammaValid`, gamma monotonicity and
  arithmetic, `prod_error_bound`, `gamma_mul`, `gamma_inv`, `gamma_div`,
  absorption lemmas such as `three_gamma_plus_sq_le_gamma`.
- `Analysis/Summation.lean`: `fl_sum_error`, `fl_sum_error_init`,
  `fl_sum_error_tight`.
- `Analysis/SubtractionFold.lean`: subtraction-fold and inverse-product
  error lemmas used by triangular substitution proofs.
- `Analysis/MatrixAlgebra.lean`: exact matrix operations, inverses, norms,
  transpose, Frobenius algebra, orthogonal matrices, Neumann-series style
  bounds. This is foundational but very large and could eventually be split.
- `Analysis/PerturbationTheory.lean`: residual, normwise/componentwise
  perturbation, Oettli-Prager, Rigal-Gaches, Skeel condition definitions.

## Strong Reuse Chain

- `Rounding` supports `Summation` and `SubtractionFold`.
- `Summation` supports `DotProduct`.
- Exact algebraic operations should be separated from rounded algorithms.
  For dot product, Mathlib's `x ⬝ᵥ y = ∑ i, x i * y i` is the exact
  specification, while local `fl_dotProduct` is the rounded left-to-right
  recurrence using `fp.fl_mul` and `fp.fl_add`.  Stability theorems should
  compare the rounded algorithm to the exact Mathlib specification; they should
  not pretend the whole dot product always has a single global relative error,
  because cancellation can make that false.
- `DotProduct` supports `MatVec`.
- `MatVec` supports `MatMul` and matrix inversion residual results.
- `DotProduct` supports `Norm2`, which gives the reusable `fl_norm2Sq` and
  `fl_norm2` kernels needed by Householder reflector construction.  `Norm2`
  bridges exact squared norms to Mathlib `dotProduct` through
  `exactNorm2Sq_eq_dotProduct`, while preserving the existing function-based
  vector API.
- `Norm2` supports `QR/HouseholderReflector.lean`, which defines sign choice,
  rounded Householder vector construction, rounded beta, and the exact
  orthogonal reflector associated with a computed vector.  `householderSign`
  intentionally has value `1` at zero, so it is local, but it agrees with
  Mathlib `Real.sign` away from zero.
- `HouseholderReflector`/`DotProduct` support the first implementation-backed
  QR application kernel: `QR/HouseholderApply.lean` defines
  `fl_householderApply` and proves its unrolled rounding-error and
  matrix-perturbation forms.
- `TriangularSolve` and `ForwardSub` use `SubtractionFold`/`Rounding` and feed
  `TriangularSolveCombined`, `ForwardError`, `MMatrix`, LU solve, Cholesky
  solve, matrix inversion, and underdetermined systems.
- `ForwardError` combines triangular backward error with exact inverse
  predicates from `MatrixAlgebra`.
- LU modules build from Gaussian elimination specs into solve and growth-factor
  results; Cholesky solve reuses triangular solves and Cholesky specs.

## Known Weak Spots

These compile, but should not be treated as fully derived stability results:

- `Algorithms/MatrixInversion.lean` no longer has `True` placeholder fields in
  `BlockMethod1BSpec`.  The block-indexing details remain abstract, but the
  spec now exposes the concrete per-column backward-error contract used to
  prove `triInv_method1B_right_residual_from_spec`.
- Several high-level theorems are wrappers around a hypothesis that is already
  essentially the conclusion:
  `GaussJordan.lean` recurrence/forward/backward/SPD residual wrappers;
  `MatrixInversion.lean` method 2, method 2C, method D, and SPD method D
  wrappers; `CholeskyDemmel.lean` scaled forward-error wrapper;
  `CholeskyIndefinite.lean` Bunch-Parlett/Bunch-Kaufman wrappers;
  `CholeskyNonsym.lean` nonsymmetric PD growth and Mathias success wrappers;
  `CholeskyPSD.lean` Schur perturbation, W-norm, complete-pivoting, and
  termination wrappers; `CholeskyPerturbation.lean` normwise perturbation
  wrapper; `SylvesterPerturbation.lean` first-order linearized wrapper.
- These wrappers are acceptable as named interfaces only if the supplied
  hypothesis is intentionally an abstract external theorem. They should not be
  advertised as internally proved from the FP model.  These wrappers were
  redocumented as abstract interfaces in the 2026-04-26 fix pass.

## Organization Notes

- The core library organization is coherent: model -> analysis infrastructure
  -> low-level algorithms -> higher-level algorithms.
- `MatrixAlgebra.lean` is over 1200 lines and mixes general algebra, norms,
  orthogonality, and Neumann theory. A future split into matrix basics, norms,
  orthogonal/Frobenius, and Neumann/resolvent infrastructure would improve
  maintainability.
- Triangular inverse infrastructure is split across
  `TriangularForwardBound.lean` and `InverseBounds.lean`. This works, but a
  neutral `Analysis/TriangularAlgebra.lean` or `Algorithms/TriangularInverse`
  module would make the dependency story cleaner.
- `MMatrix.lean` proves the Corollary 8.10 relative-error statement in μ-form
  via `mmatrix_forwardSub_relative_error`.  It does not separately formalize
  the asymptotic simplification `μ_i ≤ (n²+n+1)u + O(u²)` as a Big-O theorem.
## Branch Notes

- Benchmark artifacts and benchmark-specific decision notes were moved to
  branch `benchmark` on 2026-04-28.
- Keep benchmark task files, stubs, generated-workspace scripts, run protocols,
  and task-selection rationale off `main` unless the user explicitly decides to
  merge them back.
- Library implementation work after the benchmark audit lives on
  `end-to-end-rebuild`, renamed from the earlier QR-specific branch.
  The first step is bottom-up QR strengthening:
  keep existing QR contracts unchanged, add concrete rounded kernels, then
  prove bridge theorems showing the kernels satisfy the contracts.

## 2026-05 QR Implementation Work

- Added `Algorithms/QR/HouseholderApply.lean` as the first concrete QR kernel.
- Corrected the QR implementation plan to start with missing low-level
  primitives rather than treating reflector construction as permanently out of
  scope.
- Extended `FPModel` with `fl_sqrt` and `model_sqrt` for nonnegative real
  inputs.
- Added `Algorithms/Norm2.lean` with exact and floating 2-norm kernels:
  `exactNorm2Sq`, `exactNorm2`, `fl_norm2Sq`, `fl_norm2`,
  `fl_norm2Sq_backward_error`, `fl_norm2Sq_nonneg_of_gammaValid_two_mul`,
  `fl_norm2_unroll`, and `fl_norm2_unroll_of_gammaValid_two_mul`.
- Added `Algorithms/QR/HouseholderReflector.lean` with `householderSign`,
  `exactHouseholderBeta`, `fl_householderAlpha`, `fl_householderVector`,
  `fl_householderBeta`, `exactHouseholderFromRoundedVector`, and the
  orthogonality bridge `exactHouseholder_orthogonal`.
- Added Mathlib alignment bridges: `exactNorm2Sq_eq_dotProduct`,
  `exactNorm2Sq_eq_zero_iff`, `exactNorm2Sq_pos_iff`,
  `householderSign_zero`, and `householderSign_eq_realSign_of_ne`.
- Added construction unroll lemmas: `fl_householderAlpha_unroll`,
  `fl_householderVector_unroll`, and `fl_householderBeta_unroll`.
- `fl_householderApply fp n v β b` models the rounded operation order
  `σ̂ = fl(vᵀb)`, `τ̂ = fl(βσ̂)`, `ŷᵢ = fl(bᵢ - fl(τ̂vᵢ))`, with `v` and `β`
  already supplied.
- `fl_householderApply_unroll` reuses `dotProduct_backward_error` and the
  `FPModel` multiplication/subtraction axioms to expose the exact local
  rounding-error witnesses.
- `fl_householderApply_matrix_perturbation` proves the concrete computation can
  be written as `(P + ΔP)b` for `P = I - βvvᵀ`.
- `fl_householderApply_appError_actualBound` connects the concrete kernel to
  the existing `HouseholderAppError` contract using the actual perturbation norm
  as the bound.
- This is not yet the full Higham Lemma 18.2 closed-form bound, and it is not
  yet a full `fl_householder_qr` factorization.  The low-level square-root and
  norm construction layer now exists; the remaining work is proving the
  reflector-construction perturbation properties, bounding Householder
  application with Higham's closed form, and composing repeated reflectors.

## 2026-04-26 Fix Pass

- Created and used branch `codex/library-integrity-fixes`.
- Replaced the explicit Method 1B block-inversion placeholders with a meaningful
  `BlockMethod1BSpec` containing `block_count_le_dim`,
  `lower_triangular_inverse`, and `column_backward_error`.
- Added `triInv_method1B_right_residual_from_spec`, which derives the Method 1B
  residual from the new spec using the existing per-column residual proof.
- Redocumented abstract high-level interfaces in `MatrixInversion`,
  `GaussJordan`, Cholesky chapter modules, and Sylvester perturbation so their
  hypothesis status is explicit.
- Corrected the `MMatrix` Corollary 8.10 documentation and README theorem name
  (`mmatrix_forwardSub_relative_error`, not `corollary_8_10`).
- Removed a misleading prose false-positive for `admit` in the SPD docstring of
  `LU/GaussianElimination.lean`.
- Validation after edits: `lake build` completed successfully; scans found no
  Lean `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom`/`opaque` tokens and no explicit `True`
  placeholder block specs or stale “full Corollary 8.10 future work” claims.
  The remaining build warnings are the pre-existing linter warnings in
  QR/least-squares/fast-matmul modules.

## Maintenance Rules For Future Work

- Preserve the axiomatic `FPModel`; do not add IEEE-specific assumptions unless
  they are in a separate optional module.
- Prefer deriving new algorithm bounds from existing foundation theorems rather
  than restating a bound as a hypothesis.
- When adding high-level theorem wrappers around external assumptions, label
  them as abstract/specification transfer theorems, not as full internal error
  analyses.
- Keep public constants exact when Higham gives exact gamma constants. Avoid
  weakening constants unless the theorem name and docs say so.
- Before saying something is absent, search with `rg`/`rg --files`; this
  library is large enough that memory alone is unreliable.
- Prioritize fixes and new formalizations that improve compositional reuse for
  stability proofs, especially kernel contracts useful in larger algorithms.
- Run `lake build` after edits and check for new warnings.
