# Shared-file requests

Workers do not edit integrator-owned manifests, root aggregates, tests, CI, or
phase checkpoints directly. The integrator creates one `Rxxxx.json` plus its
hash-pinned `Rxxxx.patch` here for every requested shared change. A request is
valid only through its target checkpoint and must become applied, rejected,
withdrawn, expired, or superseded when that checkpoint changes.

There are no active shared-file requests at checkpoint C0001.
